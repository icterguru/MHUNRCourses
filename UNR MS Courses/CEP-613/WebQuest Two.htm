information relating to the tools and techniques for finding information on the 
Internet. Many people use the Internet and they find information by using 
different tools and strategies. However, the search tools and strategies, like 
the Internet itself, are changing. Some understanding and knowledge of the best 
ways and means for searching the Internet can improve the efficiency of students 
and teachers in finding desired information. In this WebQuest, you will study 
the latest techniques and strategies for searching the Internet and prepare a 
workshop for teachers to help them understand and use these tools and 
techniques. </FONT>

<P><FONT size=3>The World Wide Web contains over two billion Web sites and there 
is a plethora of electronic information that is not on the Web. An important 
question is, How do you find the information you want? Different people use 
different strategies, of course, and they also use different strategies in 
different situations. You probably already have a favorite strategy for finding 
what you want on the Web. You have the assignment of preparing a workshop for 
teachers who have only used the Internet on a limited basis and who can benefit 
from knowing about and understanding how to find what they want in the most 
efficient manner. </FONT>

tools, go to this Web site for a thorough and easy to understand tutorial. <A

<P>After you have gone through the tutorial and feel that you understand the 
latest tools and techniques for searching the Internet and the Web, prepare a 
PowerPoint presentation for your workshop. Send this presentation as an 
attachment to your instructor. </P>
