<P><B><U><FONT color=#cc0000 size=+1>Task</FONT></U></B><BR><BR>Since you are 
well trained in using technology to enhance teaching and learning, you have been 
asked to present a workshop for a group of fellow teachers on how to integrate 
technology into the classroom. The school district has assured you that this 
will be a model school and that, within reason, the necessary hardware, 
software, and connectivity will be made available. Your first task will be to 
prepare a PowerPoint presentation that will cover the first hour of the 
workshop. You will use the outline below as the guide for your presentation. 
serve as an introduction to the workshop. This well be the first presentation of 
the workshop and will introduce the participating teachers to the topic and 
provide an overview of what the workshop will cover.</P>

<P class=style7><U>Conclusion</U> 
<P class=style5>In this WebQuest you have had an opportunity to think through a 
model classroom that integrates information technology into the curriculum. The 
sky was the limit and you should have had fun creating this learning environment 
without restrictions. The real world will obviously not be this way, but this 
experience will help you know what you want and help you request useful 
resources when and if the time comes that you do have the opportunity to add to 
your classroom technology base. <U><BR><BR></U></P></BODY></HTML>
