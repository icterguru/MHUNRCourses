      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>Since early in 1995, teachers everywhere have learned how to use the 
      web well by adopting the <A href="http://webquest.sdsu.edu/" 
      target=_blank>WebQuest</A> format to create inquiry-oriented lessons. But 
      what exactly <I>is</I> a WebQuest? What does it feel like to do one? How 
      do you know a good one when you see it? In the space of 90 minutes, you're 
      going to grapple with these questions and more. </P>
      <H2>The Task</H2>
      <P>To develop great WebQuests, you need to develop a thorough 
      understanding of the different possibilities open to you as you create 
      web-based lessons. One way for you to get there is to critically analyze a 
      number of webquest examples and discuss them from multiple perspectives. 
      That's your task in this exercise.</P>
      <P>By the end of this lesson, you and your group will answer these 
      questions:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>Which two of example WebQuests listed below are the <I>best</I> 
        ones? Why? 
        <LI>Which two are the <I>worst</I>? Why? 
        <LI>What do <I>best</I> and <I>worst</I> mean to you? </LI></OL>
      <H2>The Process</H2>
      <OL>
        <LI>First, each participant will have a hard copy of <A 
        href="http://webquest.sdsu.edu/wqworksheet-es.html">the worksheet</A>. 
        To answer the questions given above, you'll break into groups of four. 
        Within the group, each of you will take on one of the following 
        roles:<BR><BR>

              src="A WebQuest about WebQuests_files/clokfce1.gif" width=18 
              align=bottom> <B>The Efficiency Expert: </B>You value time a great 
              deal. You believe that too much time is wasted in today's 
              classrooms on unfocused activity and learners not knowing what 
              they should be doing at a given moment. To you, a good WebQuest is 
              one that delivers the most learning bang for the buck. If it's a 
              short, unambitious activity that teaches a small thing well, then 
              you like it. If it's a longterm activity, it had better deliver a 
              deep understanding of the topic it covers, in your view.</P></TD>
            <TD vAlign=top width="50%" bgColor=#ffffcc>
              <P><IMG height=18 hspace=3 
              src="A WebQuest about WebQuests_files/hapyface.gif" width=18 
              align=bottom> <B>The Affiliator: </B>To you, the best learning 
              activities are those in which students learn to work together. 
              WebQuests that force collaboration and create a need for 
              discussion and consensus are the best in your view. If a WebQuest 
              could be done by a student working alone, it leaves you 
            cold.</P></TD></TR>

              src="A WebQuest about WebQuests_files/atom.gif" width=21 
              align=bottom> <B>The Altitudinist: </B>Higher level thinking is 
              everything to you. There's too much emphasis on factual recall in 
              schools today. The only justification for bringing technology into 
              schools is if it opens up the possibility that students will have 
              to analyze information, synthesize multiple perspectives, and take 
              a stance on the merits of something. You also value sites that 
              allow for some creative expression on the part of the 
            learner.</P></TD>

              align=bottom> <B>The Technophile: </B>You love this internet 
              thang. To you, the best WebQuest is one that makes the best use of 
              the technology of the Web. If a WebQuest has attractive colors, 
              animated gifs, and lots of links to interesting sites, you love 
              it. If it makes minimal use of the Web, you'd rather use a 
              worksheet.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>
        <LI>Individually, you'll examine each of the sites below and use the 
        worksheet to jot down some notes of your opinions of each from the 
        perspective of your role. You'll need to examine each site fairly 
        quickly. Don't spend more than 7 minutes on any one site. Your 
        instructor will keep time using this clock:<BR><BR>

        <LI>When everyone in the group has seen all the sites, it's time to get 
        together to answer the questions. One way to proceed would be to go 
        around and poll each team member for the best two and worst two from 
        their perspective. Pay attention to each of the other perspectives, even 
        if at first you think you might disagree with them.<BR><BR>
        <LI>There will probably not be unanimous agreement, so the next step is 
        to talk together to hammer out a compromise consensus about your team's 
        nominations for best and worst. Pool your perspectives and see if you 
        can agree on what's best for the learner. <EM><STRONG>DO NOT JUST TALLY 
        UP THE VOTES AND DECLARE A WINNER</STRONG></EM>. Instead, begin to put 
        aside your individual perspective and come to an agreement that takes 
        into account all four perspectives.<BR><BR>
        <LI>One person in each group should record the group's thoughts.<BR><BR>
        <LI>When debriefing time is called, report your results to the whole 
        class. Do you think the other groups will agree with your conclusions? 
        </LI></OL>
      <H2>Conclusion</FONT></H2>
      <P>Ideally, this exercise will provide you with a larger pool of ideas to 
      work with as you develop your WebQuest-making skills. The best WebQuest is 
      yet to be written. It might be yours!</P>
