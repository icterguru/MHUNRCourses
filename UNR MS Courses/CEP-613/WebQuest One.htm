<P>In this course you will deal with a teaching and learning technique called a 
WebQuest. You will use the technique in two (2) ways. First, you will complete 
the lessons and assignments in the course as WebQuests, structured in the 
WebQuest format. Second, you will create a WebQuest as a "teaching/learning 
plan" and post it on the Web. You will begin with this first WebQuest (WebQuest 
1). <FONT size=3>This WebQuest will familiarize you with WebCampus, which is 
UNR's Web learning management system. This system is UNR's version of 
Blackboard, which is a natioonwide management system for electronic learning. 
You will also use some Internet communications tools, such as email and 
discussion. </FONT></P>
