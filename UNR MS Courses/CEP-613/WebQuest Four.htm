<P><FONT size=3>Whether or not the integration of information technology into 
the classroom is eff ective has been and remains a controversial issue. In this 
WebQuest, you will do some reading and Web browsing relative to this issue. You 
will then summarize your findings in a paper to support the position that 
integrating information technology into the classroom can enhance teaching and 
learning. </FONT>

Statement</FONT><BR>This is the press statement you will react 
to:<BR></STRONG></FONT><FONT size=3>Current approaches to technology education, 
supported by CoSN, the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), 
and the U.S. Department of Education, emphasize the use of advanced technologies 
by every child and every teacher from kindergarten on up. Yet there is an 
appalling lack of research evidence justifying this massive and costly 
experiment, particularly if one looks for long-term, cost-effective gains. Just 
this year, Susan Patrick, head of the Office of Educational Technology at the 
Education Department, admitted that evidence for the effectiveness of high 
technology in education was lacking and that “despite a decade of investment, 
most achievement indicators are flat.”</FONT> </P>

<CENTER>
<P align=left>In this WebQuest, you have explored evidence that argues in favor 
of the integration of information technology in the classroom. You have had an 
opportunity to synthesize this evidence by writing a persuasive editorial 
refuting the naysayers who argue that spending money on information technology 
in education is a waste. </CENTER>
